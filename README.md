## Tech-stack
Min API level is set to 21, so the presented approach is suitable for over 94% of devices running Android. This project takes advantage of many popular libraries and tools of the Android ecosystem. Most of the libraries are in the stable version unless there is a good reason to use non-stable dependency.
-   [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack):
    -   [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html)  - provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
    -   [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx)  - major improvement to the original Android  [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    -   [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)  - allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views/
    -   [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle)  - perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    -   [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)  - lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
    -   [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/)  - helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
    -   [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)  - persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
    -   [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)  - designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
-   [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)  - managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
-    [Rxkt](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin)  - cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception
-   [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)  - dependency injector for replacement all Factory classes.
-   [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)  - type-safe HTTP client.
-   [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)  - image loading and caching library
